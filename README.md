# Course-Site-Generator

The Course Site Generator was built for CSE219: Object Oriented Design at Stony Brook University.
This JavaFX application allows a user to customize a course calendar, homework assignment list, teaching assistantlist and office hours schedule. It exports a full course website consisting of an HTML template, a JSON file with user content and a JavaScript program that populates the template with content.
